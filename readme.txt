The toplinks plugin takes advantage of the sidebar widget feature available in Wordpress 2.2+ and above. 
If you don’t know what version you are running, login to your Wordpress admin and look at the bottom of the page, the version 
number is there. It should also be noted that your Wordpress theme must support sidebar widgets (if you are a theme developer 
and want to “Widgetize” your theme, check http://automattic.com/code/widgets/themes/)



== Installation ==

We offer a quick install guide here, but if you’ve never installed a Wordpress plugin before, you can follow 
[this excellent documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins)

   1. Download the plugin you wish to install from our download page.
   2. Unzip the contents of the plugin zip file to your wp-content/plugins directory (do not rename the directory that it unzips to).
   3. Enable the plugin through the Plugins tab in your Wordpress admin panel.
   4. Set the position of the friendsroll or toplinks sidebar widget in your Wordpress admin panel (Presentation->Widgets).
   5. Have fun.
